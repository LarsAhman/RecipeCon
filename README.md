# RecipeCon
A tool to convert ingredient lists to between metric and US customary systems.


Paste your Ingredient list into the text box on the left.
The ingredients must be separated by a linebreak (enter key).


The following types of ingredients work:

2 dl milk

6 fl oz cream

4 cucumbers

six cabbages

a pair of eggs

salt to taste

some cloves of garlic


The amount, units and the ingredient's name must be separated by spaces.
If the unit you inserted isn't recognized, it is possible that you are 
using a variant of the unit's name that I haven't added to the conversion tables yet. 
For example dl can also be deciliter or decileters.
You can check the added unit names in the UnitSystemPairs folder.
